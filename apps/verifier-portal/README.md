# Dtrust Verifier Portal

Public-facing portal for verifying document authenticity on the Hedera network.

## Overview

The Verifier Portal is a clean, single-purpose application that allows anyone to:

- Verify if a document has been anchored to Hedera
- Check document authenticity without uploading the file
- Get instant verification results

## Features

- **Privacy-First**: Documents are hashed locally in the browser

### üîí Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Hashing**: SHA-256 calculated using Web Crypto API
- **No File Upload**: Documents never leave your browser
- **Tamper-Proof**: Verification against immutable Hedera ledger

### üé® Clear Visual Feedback

- **‚úÖ Verified** (Green): Document found on Hedera network
- **‚ùå Not Verified** (Red): Document not found or has been modified
- Detailed verification information when available

## Pages

## How Verification Works

1. **Upload Document**: User drops or selects a file
2. **Local Hashing**: SHA-256 hash calculated in browser using Web Crypto API
3. **Hedera Lookup**: Hash is checked against Hedera network records
4. **Display Result**: Clear ‚úÖ or ‚ùå feedback with details

## API Integration

### Verify Document

```typescript
POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/verify
Body: { hash, fileName }
Response: { verified: boolean, details: {...} }
```

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ Verified

- Document hash found on Hedera network
- Shows transaction ID
- Shows anchoring timestamp
- Shows organization (if available)

### ‚ùå Not Verified

- Document hash not found
- Could mean:
  - Document was never anchored
  - Document has been modified since anchoring
  - Hash mismatch
